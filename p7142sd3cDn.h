/// @brief A p7142Dn downconverter class for P7142 cards running SD3C firmware.
///
/// In the firmware, each channel contains a downconverter implemented with csac
/// filters. The csac filters have a gaussian and a kaiser filter in series. The
/// filter coefficients are configurable.
///
/// In the firmware, the downconverter is followed by user selectable processing
/// modes. Each option configures the firmware timing differently, and
/// delivers the data in a different format.
///
/// A beam of data is defined as the I and Q values for one set of range gates.
/// Baseband I and Q data may be either 16 bits or 32 bits, depending on the 
/// operating mode. Baseband data delivered to the host application via the 
/// read() method.
///
/// The modes are:
/// <ul>
/// <li>free running (fr): There is no gating of the received data. The baseband
/// signal is output as a free running stream of 16 bit I and Q values.</li>
/// <li> pulse tagger (pt): The downconversion is gated at the prt rate, and the
/// specified number of gates is processed on each cycle. A synchronization word
/// and a pulse count are prepended to the beam of baseband data.</li>
/// <li> coherent integration (ci).: The downconversion is gated at the prt 
/// rate, and the specified number of gates is processed on each cycle. The prt
/// is divided into even and odd pulses. I and values for even and odd pulses 
/// are accumulated separately for all gates. When the accumulation is finished,
/// an  eight byte tag is prepended, and the I and Q summs for even and odd 
/// beams is output. </li>
/// </ul>
///
/// <h2>p7142sd3cDn usage</h2>
/// A large part of this class is involved with configuring the SD3C firmware on
/// the Pentek card. Filter coefficients, timing parameters, and the data 
/// processing section must be configured properly.
///
/// The other activity is the actual collection of the baseband data stream.
/// Consumer applications call p7142sd3cDn to deliver I and Q data blocks, on a 
/// beam by beam basis. The p7142sd3cDn class handles detection and recovery 
/// from dropped data and synchronization errors. The consumer simply calls 
/// nextBeam() for the next beam of I and Q data, and the p7142sd3cDn will block
/// until the request can be satisfied.
///
/// Synchronization is performed when operating in the pulse tagging and
/// coherent integration modes. Synchronization is required
/// because it is possible for data to be dropped somewhere in the path from
/// the SD3C to the delivery via the read() call. This synchronization
/// can result in a certain amount of shifting and filling of
/// buffers. Since any significant synchronization loss rate will not be 
/// acceptable in the system, we rely on the assumption that the number of 
/// re-syncs to be small, and these small scale buffer manipulations should not
/// incur a significant overall processing cost. If re-synchronization occurs 
/// frequently, there is a hardware or design issue with the system which must 
/// be corrected.
///
/// @todo It appears that the endianness of the pulse tagger sync word may
/// not be accounted for here. If the sync code is ever changed to a 
/// non-symmetrical value, the simulation and synchronization code may break.
///
/// <h2>Coherent Integrator</h2>
/// The coherent integrator firmware in SD3C creates a data stream which is
/// a little more complicated that the free run and pulse tagger modes. Because
/// the coherent integrator tags cover 16 bytes, four of which contain fixed 
/// fields, this data stream does not contain separate sync words like the pulse
/// tagger produces. The coherent integrator data format is documented in the 
/// SD3C VHDL as follows:
/// @code
/// TAG_I_EVEN TAG_Q_EVEN TAG_I_ODD TAG_Q_ODD IQpairs,even pulse IQpairs,odd pulse
///
/// The TAG is broken down as:
/// bits 31:28  Format number   0-15(4 bits)
/// bits 27:26  Channel number  0-3 (2 bits)
/// bit     25  0=even, 1=odd   0-1 (1 bit)
/// bit     24  0=I, 1=Q        0-1 (1 bit)
/// bits 23:00  Sequence number     (24 bits)
///
///
/// The four tags at the beginning should all have the same sequence number,
/// verifying that the individual accumulators are working in sequence.
/// The sequence number increments by one for each output sum from
/// an accumulator.
