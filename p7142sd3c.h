/// characteristics, as does the second pair.

/// <h2>Simulation</h2>
/// For development and testing without the transceiver hardware, the p7142sd3c can
/// be configured to operate in simulation mode. In this case, the p7142Dn class
/// is configured for simulation as well, and its read() function will synthesize
/// simulated data. p7142sd3c will add sync words and tags as appropriate, depending on the
/// operating mode. Synchronization errors are randomly inserted when operating in
/// simulation mode.
